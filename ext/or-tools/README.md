This directory contains data structures and algorithms for linear sum assignment problems:
* [assignment.h](./assignment.h): Entry point for solving linear sum assignment problems
  (classical assignment problems where the total cost is the sum of the costs
  of each arc used) on directed graphs with arc costs, based on a push-relabel
  algorithm of Goldberg and Kennedy.

The code has been adapted starting from the OR-Tools - Google Optimization Tools project.
