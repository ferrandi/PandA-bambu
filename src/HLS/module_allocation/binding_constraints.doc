  \page src_HLS_binding_constraints_page Binding constraints

  A kind of implementation constraint for the high-level synthesis is a <B>resource binding constraint</B>.
  In this case, a particular operation is required to be implemented by a given resource.
  These constraints are motivated by the designer's previous knowledge, or intuition,
  that one particular choice is the best and that other choices do not need investigation.

  Architectural synthesis with resource binding constraints is often referred to as synthesis from partial 
  structure. Design systems that support such a feature allow a designer to specify a circuit in a wide spectrum 
  of ways, ranging from a full behavioral model to a structural one. This modeling capability may be useful 
  to leverage previously designed components.

  When binding constraints are specified, a resource binding must be compatible with them. In particular, a partial 
  binding may be part of the original specification. This corresponds 
  to specifying a binding for a subset of the operations \f$U\subseteq V_o\f$. A resource binding is compatible with a 
  partial binding when its restriction to the operations \f$U\f$ is identical to the partial binding itself.

  A <b>partial binding</b> is defined as a relation \f$\beta\f$ between an 
  operation vertex into the behavioral specification and the functional unit instance where it will have 
  to be executed:
  \f$
   \beta(v_l) = (t,r)
  \f$
  where \f$v_l\in V_o\f$ is an operation of type \f$l\f$ to be executed, \f$t\f$ is a functional unit that 
  is able to executed the operation type \f$l\f$ and \f$r\f$ is an integer representing the instance of the 
  functional unit in the design. The following algorithms will accept this information as a constraint, 
  without investigate why it has been imposed.


  \section src_HLS_binding_constraints_parsing Binding constraints in the Bambu tool

  Once the internal representation has been created and the informations about resources and constraints 
  have been loaded, some additional informations can be added to ensure that operations will be bounded on 
  specific resources. In fact, as described in many books regarding high-level synthesis, the allocation task 
  can be performed before scheduling one and a <I>partial binding</I> can be introduced to partially control 
  the area occupation on the final design. 

  In Bambu tool, this information can be provided by an XML file, where the binding constraints are specified 
  (see \ref src_frontend_HLS_constraintsIOParser). The information can be represented as follows:
\verbatim
  <constraints>
    <HLS_constraints>
      <binding_constraints vertex_name="simple_add_1_28_38" 
                           fu_name="plus_expr_FU" fu_index="0"/>
      <binding_constraints vertex_name="simple_add_1_28_39" 
                           fu_name="plus_expr_FU" fu_index="0"/>
    </HLS_constraints>
  </constraints>
\endverbatim
  where <i>simple_add_1_28_38</i> and <I>simple_add_1_28_39</i> are both bound to functional unit plus_expr_FU:0. Note 
  that forces the two operations to be executed in different control steps (provided they are not in mutual exclusion),
  since they can not use the same functional unit in the same control step.

  \if BEAGLE
  In the mixed high-level synthesis, this information is used for chromosome encoding and it allows to perform design 
  space exploration oriented to optimize the figures of merit and search the best trade-offs between execution 
  time (spreading operations in different functional units, to reduce latency, this leads to increase area occupation)
  and area occupation (trying to concentrate operations in the same functional units, this could lead to increase 
  latency, as explained above).
  \endif

  \subsection sec_binding_constraints_in_hls Storing binding constraints

  This information is so added to the HLS_constraints data structure as additional constraints to be met by 
  the final design. Note that the following steps simply use this datastructure to have informations about binding
  constraints. In particular, the method HLS_constraints::bind_vertex_to_fu can be used to bind an operation of the 
  behavioral specification to a functional unit. The binding constraints are so stored in the datastructure
  HLS_constraints::binding_constraints as a map between the operation name (as given by the macro GET_NAME) and 
  a pair of strings representing the library name and the functional unit name.

  Therefore, the algorithms will be executed as usual on operations where no constraints have been specified. 
  The algorithms will have the freedom to assign the operations to any 
  admissible and free functional units. At the opposite, if constraints have been imposed, the algorithms 
  will have to satisfy them, since they can be considered as a request formulated by the designer to consider 
  the final design as feasible.
