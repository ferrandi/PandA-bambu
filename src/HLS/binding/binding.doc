The data path describes a register transfer level design analogous to a schematic diagram. The data path is described in terms of modules and their interconnections.

<b>Datapath</B>: The datapath (\f$DP\f$) is a graph \f$DP(M_o\cup M_s \cup M_i,I)\f$ where
 - a set \f$M = M_o\cup M_s\cup M_i\f$, whose elements, called modules, are the nodes of the graph, with
   - a set \fM_o\f of <i>operational</I> modules like adders, multipliers and ALUs (see \ref src_HLS_module_binding_page),
   - a set \fM_s\f of <i>storage</I> modules like registers and register files (see \ref src_HLS_registerAllocation_page),
   - a set \f$M_i\f$ of <i>interconnection</I> modules like multiplexers, demultiplexers busses and bus drivers (see \ref src_HLS_datapath_connection_binding_page);
 - an interconnection relation \f$I\subseteq M\times M\f$, whose elements are interconnection links. These are the edges of the datapath graph.
