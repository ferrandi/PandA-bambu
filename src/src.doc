  \section src_intro Introduction
 
  This is the Tools and (Sub)Projects introduction
  
  \section src_tools Tools

  The tools that can be configured and so enabled are:
  \if BAMBU - \ref src_bambu provides high-level synthesis functionalities \endif
  \if EUCALYPTUS - \ref src_eucalyptus allows the characterization of resources in the technology library \endif

  \section src_subprojects Subprojects 

  Creation and dumping of intermediate representation:
  - Subproject \ref src_parser_page "Parsers:" provides all the available parsers, adopted to acquire the data that the tools use as input to their algorithms.
  - Subproject \ref src_graph_page "Graph:" contains the definition of the graph-based descriptions.
  - Subproject \ref src_polixml_page "POLIXML:" contains the definition of a simple and easy-to-use XML library.
  - Subproject \ref src_behavior_page "Behavior:" contains functions to manage and to represent graphs with different granularity. In particular we can represent CFG/DFG/CDG/DDG/SDG for operations and CFG/DFG/Dom/PostDom for basic blocks.
  - Subproject \ref src_tree_page provides "Tree:" functions to manage and to represent the tree computed by the GCC compilation.
  - Subproject \ref src_frontend_page "Frontend:" contains the algorithms adopted to build the entire intermediate representation (both tree and graph-based).
  - Subproject \ref src_backend_page "Parsers:" it provides backend functions to C, SystemC, VHDL, and Verilog descriptions.

  Resource library and circuit representation management:
  - Subproject \ref src_technology_manager_page "Technology:" provides functions to manage and to represent technology information.
  - Subproject \ref src_circuit_page "Circuit:" describes a generic data structure representing a circuit.
  - Subproject \ref src_wrapper_page "Wrappers:" it provides classes to wrap commercial synthesis tools.

  \if BAMBU
  Bambu tool:
  - Subproject \ref src_HLS_page provides algorithms for high-level synthesis. \endif

  \if PANDA
  Panda tool:
  - Subproject \ref src_codesign_page provides functionalities for HW/SW Codesign; in particular it includes  classes to compute metrics over circuits and classes to perform partitioning (both of circuits and of C specifications in the form of graphs) \endif

  \if KOALA
  Koala tool:
  - Subproject \ref src_regularity_page Extract structural and functional regularity from circuit graphs.
  - Subproject \ref src_edif_page provides the data structures necessary to manage a circuit described using the \b edif format \endif

  \if GUI
  Graphic User Interfaces:
  - Subproject \ref src_gui_page provides to PandA a graphical based interface. For the time being the graphical interface is mainly devoted to test the data structure developed by the project. \endif

  Development aids: 
  - Subproject \ref src_algorithms_page contains a set of useful algorithms that can be used to aid problem solution into development.
  - Subproject \ref src_ilp_page provides utilities used to solve ILP formulations. 
  - Subproject \ref src_utility_page contains some useful macros and functions.
