  \section  ILP_INTRO Introduction

  ILP is a set of classes providing several methods to encapsulate the interface to several Integer Linear Programming solvers.
  It is mainly intended for solving mixed integer programming even if a lot of wrapped solvers are also able to solve different Linear Programming problems.
  Currently, the wrapped solvers supported by ILP are:
  - GPLK (http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk) working as the default solver.
  - COIN-OR (http://www.coin-or.org/).
  - LP_SOLVE (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lp_solve/).

  In mathematics, Linear Programming (LP) problems are optimization problems in which the objective function and the constraints are all linear.
  The maximization problem (similarly for the minimization) is usually expressed in matrix form:

    \e maximize \f$ \mathbf{c}^T \mathbf{x} \f$

    subject to \f$ \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} \le \mathbf{b}, \, \mathbf{x} \ge 0 \f$

  Mixed integer linear programming (MIP) problem is a Linear Programming problem in which some variables are additionally required to be integer.

  To improve the efficiency of the MIP solvers we also exploit Branch and Cut algorithms provided by the considered ILP solvers.
  Branch and cut is a refinement of the standard linear programming based branch and bound approach.
  It starts by solving the continuous relaxation of an ILP formulation, thus obtaining a fractional solution. 
  At this point, the standard branch and bound algorithm would split the current problem into subproblems by 
  fixing some fractional variable to an integer value. The branch and cut approach, on the contrary, first looks for 
  linear inequalities which are violated by the current fractional optimal solution but are respected by all feasible integer
  solutions of the problem.
  These inequalities are named cuts or valid inequalities. They are added to the ILP formulation and the continuous relaxation 
  is solved once again, achieving a different (tight bound) and a different (hopefully less fractional) solution.
  The process can be repeated several times. It can even be proved that after a finite number of iterations, the solution will be 
  integer and it will be the optimal solution of the original ILP.
  The disadvantage of such a method however is that the number of iterations required is exponential and the formulation size grows 
  correspondingly, so that solving it becomes too expensive.
  Therefore, at some stage the generation of valid inequalities is interrupted and standard branching is performed.

  \section ILP_EXAMPLE Example

  In formulating the LP problem, the first step is to define the decision variables of the problem.
  Given the set of the decision variables, the objective function and constraints in terms of these decision variables are defined.

  For example, assuming that we have to produce two products: USB pen and Hard Drive USB. Their manifacturing requires two stages: assembly and testing.
  Each  USB pen requires 2 hours for assembly and 1 hour of testing, while the Hard Drive USB requires 4 hours of assembly and 1 hours of testing.
  Assuming that in each day we have at maximum 100 hours dedicated to the assemby of the two products and at maximum 40 hours for testing,
  we would like to identify which is the mix of products maximizing the revenue.

  The decision variables choosen are \f$ X_1 \f$ representing the number of USB pen produced and \f$ X_2 \f$ representing the number of Hard Drive USB produced.
  The revenue for each unit produced is 0.5 euro for USB pen and 10 euro for Hard Drive USB.

  The objective function trying to maximize the revenues can be written as:

  \f$ R = 0.5 X_1 + 10 X_2 \f$

  The associated constraints are:

   \f$ 2 X_1 + 4 X_2 \le 100 \f$ 

   \f$ 1 X_1 + 1 X_2 \le 40 \f$ 

  where all variables are non-negative:

  \f$ X_1  \ge 0 \f$, \f$ X_2 \ge 0 \f$

  The following C++ sample code use the ILP library to solve the trivial example before formulated.
  \code
  #include "meilp_solver.hpp"
  int main()
  {
    // Making the ilp problem...
    meilp_solverRef solver=meilp_solverRef(new glpk_solver()); //the wrapper will use GLPK as ILP solver.
    solver->make(0); //zero variables

    //add the two variables
    int x1, x2;
    x1=solver->add_empty_column();
    x2=solver->add_empty_column();

    //add a name to the two variables
    solver->set_col_name(x1,  "x1");
    solver->set_col_name(x2,  "x2");
    //define the two variables as integer variables
    solver->set_int(x1);
    solver->set_int(x2);

    // creating the objective function filling the variable obj_coeff
    std::map<int,double> obj_coeff;
    obj_coeff[x1] = 0.5;
    obj_coeff[x2] = 10;
    solver->objective_add(obj_coeff, meilp_solver::max);

    // Add the first constraints
    std::map<int,double> row_coeff;
    row_coeff[x1]=2;
    row_coeff[x2]=4;
    solver->add_row(row_coeff, 100.0, meilp_solver::L, "ExampleConstraints1");
    row_coeff.clear();

    // Add the second constraints
    std::map<int,double> row_coeff;
    row_coeff[x1]=1;
    row_coeff[x2]=1;
    solver->add_row(row_coeff, 40.0, meilp_solver::L, "ExampleConstraints2");
    row_coeff.clear();

    //non-negative variables are specified fixing the range of the variables
    solver->set_lowbo(x1, 0);
    solver->set_lowbo(x2, 0);

    //now we are ready to solve the problem
    int res = solver->solve();
    if(res == 0)
    {
      //Extraction of the results
      std::vector<double> values;
      solver->get_vars_solution(values);

      //And finaly we print the solution
      std::cout << "The solution is ";
      std::vector<double>:iterator it_end = values.end();
      for(std::vector<double>:iterator it = values.begin(); it != it_end; it++)
      {
        std::cout << *it << " ";
      }
      std::cout << std::endl;
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
  }
  \endcode
