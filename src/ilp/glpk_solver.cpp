              found optimal solution. It only means that the solution
              process was successful.)
   GLP_EBADB  Unable to start the search, because the initial basis speci-
              fied in the problem object is invalid—the number of basic
              (auxiliary and structural) variables is not the same as the
              number of rows in the problem object.
   GLP_ESING  Unable to start the search, because the basis matrix corre-
              sponding to the initial basis is singular within the working
              precision.
   GLP_ECOND  Unable to start the search, because the basis matrix cor-
              responding to the initial basis is ill-conditioned, i.e. its
              condition number is too large.
   GLP_EBOUND Unable to start the search, because some double-bounded
              (auxiliary or structural) variables have incorrect bounds.
   GLP_EFAIL  The search was prematurely terminated due to the solver
              failure.
   GLP_EOBJLL The search was prematurely terminated, because the ob-
              jective function being maximized has reached its lower
              limit and continues decreasing (the dual simplex only).
   GLP_EOBJUL The search was prematurely terminated, because the ob-
              jective function being minimized has reached its upper
              limit and continues increasing (the dual simplex only).
   GLP_EITLIM The search was prematurely terminated, because the sim-
              plex iteration limit has been exceeded.
   GLP_ETMLIM The search was prematurely terminated, because the time
              limit has been exceeded.
   GLP_ENOPFS The LP problem instance has no primal feasible solution
              (only if the LP presolver is used).

              (only if the LP presolver is used).
