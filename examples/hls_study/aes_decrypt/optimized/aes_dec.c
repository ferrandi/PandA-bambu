|    1. This source code is modified to unify the formats of the benchmark |
|       programs in CHStone.                                               |
|    2. Test vectors are added for CHStone.                                |
|    3. If "main_result" is 0 at the end of the program, the program is    |
|       correctly executed.                                                |
|    4. Please follow the copyright of each benchmark program.             |
