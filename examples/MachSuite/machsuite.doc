  \verbatim
  MachSuite

  MachSuite is a benchmark suite intended for accelerator-centric research.
  
  There is a Makefile in the top direcrory as well as one within each benchmark
  subdirectory.
  
  We suggest running the benchmarks locally (from their own directory) for now.
  
  Also, our validation approach does is not portable across machines.
  For now, the final check to see if the output is correct is not performed.
  We are working on fixing it. However, this should not change the computation
  or behavior of the benchmarks at all.
  
  
  Licensing
  
  All code is open source (BSD-compatible) and free to use and distribute. Please
  look in the LICENSE file for details.
  
  Citing
  
  If you use the code, we would appreciate it if you cite the following paper:
    Brandon Reagen, Robert Adolf, Sophia Yakun Shao, Gu-Yeon Wei, and David Brooks.
