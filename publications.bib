  abstract={Improving data locality of tensor data structures is a crucial optimization for maximizing the performance of Machine Learning and intensive Linear Algebra applications. While CPUs and GPUs improve data locality by means of automated caching mechanisms, FPGAs let the developer specify data structure allocation. Although this feature enables a high degree of customizability, the increasing complexity and memory footprint of modern applications prevent considering any manual approach to find an optimal allocation. For this reason, we propose a compiler optimization to automatically improve the tensor allocation of high-level software descriptions. The optimization is controlled by a flexible cost model that can be tuned by means of simple yet expressive callback functions. In this way, the user can tailor the optimization strategy with respect to the optimization goal. We tested our methodology integrating our optimization in the Bambu open-source HLS framework. In this setting, we achieved a 14% speedup on the digit recognition version proposed by the Rosetta benchmark. Moreover, we tested our optimization on the CHStone benchmark suite, achieving an average of 6% speedup. Finally, we applied our methodology on two industrial examples from the aerospace domain obtaining a 15% speedup. As a final step, we tested the versatility of our methodology inserting our optimization in the Clang software optimization flow achieving a 12% speedup on the Rosetta benchmark when running on CPU.},

 abstract={High Level Synthesis is a set of methodologies aimed at generating hardware descriptions starting from specifications written in high-level languages. While these methodologies share different elements with traditional compilation flows, there are characteristics of the addressed problem which require ad hoc management. In particular, differently from most of the traditional compilation flows, the complexity and the execution time of the High Level Synthesis techniques are much less relevant than the quality of the produced results. For this reason, fixed-point analyses, as well as successive refinement optimizations, can be accepted, provided that they can improve the quality of the generated designs. This article presents a design flow engine for the description and the execution of complex and customized synthesis flows. It supports dynamic addition of passes and dependencies, cyclic dependencies, and selective pass invalidation. Experimental results show the benefits of such type of design flows with respect to static linear design flows when applied to High Level Synthesis.},

This burdens system designers with complex system-level integration and verification. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages HLS techniques to automatically find bugs in designs composed of multiple IP blocks. Our method is particularly suitable for industrial adoption because it works without exposing sensitive information (e.g., the design specification or the component generation process). This advocates the definition and the adoption of an interoperable format for cross-vendor hardware bug detection.},

   abstract={High-Level Synthesis (HLS) for FPGAs is attracting popularity and is increasingly used to handle complex systems with multiple integrated components. To increase performance and efficiency, HLS flows now adopt several advanced optimization techniques. Aggressive optimizations and system level integration can cause the introduction of bugs that are only observable on-chip. Debugging support for circuits generated with HLS is receiving a considerable attention. Among the data that can be collected on chip for debugging, one of the most important is the state of the Finite State Machines (FSM) controlling the components of the circuit. However, this usually requires a large amount of memory to trace the behavior during the execution. This work proposes an approach that takes advantage of the HLS information and of the structure of the FSM to compress control flow traces and to integrate optimized components for on-chip debugging. The generated checkers analyze the FSM execution on-fly, automatically notifying when a bug is detected, localizing it and providing data about its cause. The traces are compressed using a software profiling technique, called Efficient Path Profiling (EPP), adapted for the debugging of hardware accelerators generated with HLS. With this technique, the size of the memory used to store control flow traces can be reduced up to 2 orders of magnitude, compared to state-of-the-art.},

   abstract={The integration of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in an aerospace system improves its efficiency and its flexibility thanks to their programmability, but increases the design complexity. The design flows indeed have to be composed of several steps to fill the gap between the starting solution, which is usually a reference sequential implementation, and the final heterogeneous solution which includes custom hardware accelerators. Among these steps, there are the analysis of the application to identify the functionalities that gain advantages in execution on hardware and the generation of their implementations by means of Hardware Description Languages. Generating these descriptions for a software developer can be a very difficult task because of the different programming paradigms of software programs and hardware descriptions. To facilitate the developer in this activity, High Level Synthesis techniques have been developed aiming at (semi-)automatically generating hardware implementations of specifications written in high level languages (e.g., C). With respect to other embedded systems scenarios, the aerospace systems introduce further constraints that have to be taken into account during the design of these heterogeneous systems. In this type of systems explicit data transfers to and from FPGAs are preferred to the adoption of a shared memory architecture. The first approach indeed potentially improves the predictability of the produced solutions, but the sizes of all the data transferred to and from any devices must be known at design time. Identifying the sizes in presence of complex C applications which use pointers can be a not so easy task. In this paper, a semi-automatic design flow based on the integration of an aerospace design flow, an application analysis technique, and High Level Synthesis methodologies is presented. The initial reference application is analyzed to identify which are the sizes of the data exchanged among the different components of the application. Next, starting from the high level specification and from the results of this analysis, High Level Synthesis techniques are applied to automatically produce the hardware accelerators.},

In this paper a methodology for the synthesis of nested irregular DoAll loops based on outer vectorization is proposed. The methodology transforms the intermediate representation of the DoAll loop to introduce vectorization and it can be easily integrated in existing state of the art High Level Synthesis flows since does not require any modification in the rest of the flow. Vectorization is not limited to perfectly nested countable loops: conditional constructs and loops with variable number of iterations are supported. Experimental results on parallel benchmarks show that the generated parallel accelerators have significant speed-up with limited penalties in terms of resource usage and frequency decrement. ",

   abstract={RDF databases naturally map to a graph representation and employ languages, such as SPARQL, that implements queries as graph pattern matching routines. Graph methods exhibit an irregular behavior: they present unpredictable, fine-grained data accesses, and are synchronization intensive. Graph data structures expose large amounts of dynamic parallelism, but are difficult to partition without generating load unbalance. In this paper, we present a novel architecture to improve the synthesis of graph methods. Our design addresses the issues of these algorithms with two components: a Dynamic Task Scheduler (DTS), which reduces load unbalance and maximize resource utilization, and a Hierarchical Memory Interface controller (HMI), which provides support for concurrent memory operations on multi-ported/multi-banked shared memories. We evaluate our approach by generating the accelerators for a set of SPARQL queries from the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM). We first analyze the load unbalance of these queries, showing that execution time among tasks can differ even of order of magnitudes. We then synthesize the queries and compare the performance of the resulting accelerators against the current state of the art. Experimental results show that our solution provides a speedup over the serial implementation close to the theoretical maximum and a speedup up to 3.45 over a baseline parallel implementation. We conclude our study by exploring the design space to achieve maximum memory channels utilization. The best design used at least three of the four memory channels for more than 90\% of the execution time.},

This is possible by tracing memory accesses in software (SW) and hardware (HW) executions on a given input dataset. The execution traces are compared performing a context-aware HW/SW address translation, leveraging alias-analysis, HLS memory allocation information and SW memory debugging practices.

   abstract={High-level synthesis (HLS) is increasingly popular for the design of high-performance and energy-efficient heterogeneous systems, shortening time-to-market and addressing today’s system complexity. HLS allows designers to work at a higher-level of abstraction by using a software program to specify the hardware functionality. Additionally, HLS is particularly interesting for designing FPGA circuits, where hardware implementations can be easily refined and replaced in the target device. Recent years have seen much activity in the HLS research community, with a plethora of HLS tool offerings, from both industry and academia. All these tools may have different input languages, perform different internal optimizations, and produce results of different quality, even for the very same input description. Hence, it is challenging to compare their performance and understand which is the best for the hardware to be implemented. We present a comprehensive analysis of recent HLS tools, as well as overview the areas of active interest in the HLS research community. We also present a first-published methodology to evaluate different HLS tools.We use our methodology to compare one commercial and three academic tools on a common set of C benchmarks, aiming at performing an in-depth evaluation in terms of performance and use of resources.},

   abstract={Modular design is becoming increasingly important in High Level Synthesis (HLS) flows. Current HLS flows generate hierarchical and modular designs that mimic the structure and call graph of the input specification by translating functions into modules. Function calls are translated by instantiating the callee module in the data-path of its caller, allowing for resource sharing when the same function is called multiple times. However, if two different callers invoke the same function, current HLS flows cannot share the instance of the module between the two callers, even if they invoke the function in a mutually exclusive way. In this paper, we propose a methodology that enables sharing of (sub)modules across modules boundaries. Sharing is obtained through function proxies, which act as forwarders of function calls in the original specification to shared modules without reducing performance. Building on the concept of function proxies, we propose a methodology and the related components to perform HLS of function calls through function pointers, without requiring complete static knowledge of the alias set (point-to set). We show that module sharing through function proxies provides valuable area savings and no significant impacts on the execution delays, and that our synthesis approach for function pointers enables dynamic polymorphism.},

   abstract={In this paper we present a set of techniques that enable the synthesis of efficient custom accelerators for memory intensive, irregular applications. To address the challenges of irregular applications (large memory footprint, unpredictable fine-grained data accesses, and high synchronization intensity), and exploit their opportunities (thread level parallelism, memory level parallelism), we propose a novel accelerator design that employs an adaptive and Distributed Controller (DC) architecture, and a Memory Interface Controller (MIC) that supports concurrent and atomic memory operations on a multi-ported/multi-banked shared memory. Among the multitude of algorithms that may benefit from our solution, we focus on the acceleration of graph analytics applications and, in particular, on the synthesis of SPARQL queries on Resource Description Framework (RDF) databases. We achieve this objective by incorporating the synthesis techniques into Bambu, an Open Source high-level synthesis tools, and interfacing it with GEMS, the Graph database Engine for Multithreaded Systems. The GEMS' front-end generates optimized C implementations of the input queries, modeled as graph pattern matching algorithms, which are then automatically synthesized by Bambu. We validate our approach by synthesizing several SPARQL queries from the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM).},

In this paper we propose a code transformation flow, based on a new extension of the System of Difference Constraints (SDC) scheduling algorithm, which introduces a large number of transformations, whose profitability is guaranteed by SDC formulation. Experimental results show that the proposed technique in average reduces the execution time of control dominated applications by 37% with respect to a commercial tool without increasing the area usage.},

   abstract={In this paper we present an approach for debugging hardware designs generated by High-Level Synthesis (HLS), relieving users from the burden of identifying the signals to trace and from the error-prone task of manually checking the traces. The necessary steps are performed after HLS, independently of it and without affecting the synthesized design. For this reason our methodology should be easily adaptable to any HLS tools. The proposed approach makes full use of HLS compile time informations. The executions of the simulated design and the original C program can be compared, checking if there are discrepancies between values of C variables and signals in the design. The detection is completely automated, that is, it does not need any input but the program itself and the user does not have to know anything about the overall compilation process. The design can be validated on a given set of test cases and the discrepancies are detected by the tool. Relationships between the original high-level source code and the generated HDL are kept by the compiler and shown to the user. The granularity of such discrepancy analysis is per-operation and it includes the temporary variables inserted by the compiler. As a consequence the design can be debugged as is, with no restrictions on optimizations available during HLS. We show how this methodology can be used to identify different kind of bugs: 1) introduced by the HLS tool used for the synthesis; 2) introduced using buggy libraries of hardware components for HLS; 3) undefined behavior bugs in the original high-level source code.},

   abstract={Correctly estimating the speed-up of a parallel embedded application is crucial to efficiently compare different parallelization techniques, task graph transformations or mapping and scheduling solutions. Unfortunately, especially in case of control-dominated applications, task correlations may heavily affect the execution time of the solutions and usually this is not properly taken into account during performance analysis. We propose a methodology that combines a single profiling of the initial sequential specification with different decisions in terms of partitioning, mapping, and scheduling in order to better estimate the actual speed-up of these solutions. We validated our approach on a multi-processor simulation platform: experimental results show that our methodology, effectively identifying the correlations among tasks, significantly outperforms existing approaches for speed-up estimation. Indeed, we obtained an absolute error less than 5% in average, even when compiling the code with different optimization levels.},

   abstract={Synchronous Data Flow graphs are widely adopted in the designing of streaming applications, but were originally formulated to describe only how an application is partitioned and which data are exchanged among different tasks. Since Synchronous Data Flow graphs are often used to describe and evaluate complete design solutions, missing information (e.g., mapping, scheduling, etc.) has to be included in them by means of further actors and channels to obtain accurate evaluations. To address this issue preserving the simplicity of the representation, techniques that model data transfer delays by means of ad-hoc actors have been proposed, but they model independently each communication ignoring contentions. Moreover, they do not usually consider at all delays due to buffer contentions, potentially overestimating the throughput of a design solution. In this paper a technique to extend Synchronous Data Flow graphs by adding ad-hoc actors and channels to model resolution of resources contentions is proposed. The results show that the number of added actors and channels is limited but that they can significantly increase the Synchronous Data Flow graph accuracy.},

   abstract={Data mining, bioinformatics, knowledge discovery, social network analysis, are emerging irregular applications that exploits data structures based on pointers or linked lists, such as graphs, unbalanced trees or unstructured grids. These applications are characterized by unpredictable memory accesses and generally are memory bandwidth bound, but also presents large amounts of inherent dynamic parallelism because they can potentially spawn concurrent activities for each one of the element they are exploring. Hybrid architectures, which integrate general purpose processors with reconfigurable devices, appears promising target platforms for accelerating irregular applications. These systems often connect to distributed and multi-ported memories, potentially enabling parallel memory operations. However, these memory architectures introduce several challenges, such as the necessity to manage concurrency and synchronization to avoid structural conflicts on shared memory locations and to guarantee consistency. In this paper we present an adaptive Memory Interface Controller (MIC) that addresses these issues. The MIC is a general and customizable solution that can target several different memory structures, and is suitable for High Level Synthesis frameworks. It implements a dynamic arbitration scheme, which avoids conflicts on memory resources at runtime, and supports atomic memory operations, commonly exploited for synchronization directives in parallel programming paradigms. The MIC simultaneously maps multiple accesses to different memory ports, allowing fine grained parallelism exploitation and ensuring correctness also in the presence of irregular and statically unpredictable memory access patterns. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach on a typical irregular kernel, graph Breadth First Search (BFS), exploring different design alternatives.},

   abstract={Classical techniques for register allocation and binding require the definition of the program execution order, since a partial ordering relation between operations must be induced to perform liveness analysis through data-flow equations. In High Level Synthesis (HLS) flows this is commonly obtained through the scheduling task. However for some HLS approaches, such a relation can be difficult to be computed, or not statically computable at all, and adopting conventional register binding techniques, even when feasible, cannot guarantee maximum performances. To overcome these issues we introduce a novel scheduling-independent liveness analysis methodology, suitable for dynamic scheduling architectures. Such liveness analysis is exploited in register binding using standard graph coloring techniques, and unlike other approaches it avoids the insertion of structural dependencies, introduced to prevent run-time resource conflicts in dynamic scheduling environments. The absence of additional dependencies avoids performance degradation and makes parallelism exploitation independent from the register binding task, while on average not impacting on area, as shown through the experimental results.},

   abstract={High Level Synthesis (HLS) provides a way to significantly enhance the productivity of embedded system designers, by enabling the automatic or semiautomatic generation of hardware accelerators starting from high level descriptions with (usually software) programming languages. Typical HLS approaches build a centralized Finite State Machine (FSM) to control the generated datapath, performing the operations according to a pre-determined, static schedule. However, FSM-based approaches are only able to extract parallelism within a single execution flow. In the presence of coarse grained parallelism, in the form of concurrent function calls or parallel control structures, they either serialize all the operations, or build excessively complex controllers, aiming at executing as many operation as possible in a single control step (i.e., they try to extract as much instruction level parallelism as possible). The resulting controllers occupy an excessive amount of area or lead to very low operating frequencies. In this paper we propose a methodology for the HLS of accelerators supporting parallel execution and dynamic scheduling. The approach exploits an adaptive distributed controller, composed of a set of communicating elements associated with each operation. This controller design enables supporting multiple concurrent execution flows, thus increasing parallelism exploitation beyond instruction level parallelism. The approach also supports variable latency operations, such as memory accesses and speculative operations. We apply our methodology on a set of typical HLS benchmarks, and demonstrate valuable speed ups with limited area overheads with respect to conventional FSM-based flows.},

Components with variable latency and unpredictable behavior are becoming predominant in hardware designs. Conventional hardware cores underperform when dealing with unknown or uncertain information. Common High-Level Synthesis (HLS) approaches, which require to specify the complete behavior at design-time, present significant restrictions in supporting this kind of conditions. The literature proposes several dynamic scheduling techniques to improve the cores performance by handling inherent uncertainty of applications. However, they do not address other sources of unknown information. In this paper, we propose the dynamic Activating Conditions (AC)-scheduling: a methodology for the design automation of hardware cores which can dynamically adapt the instructions scheduling according to behaviors unknown at design-time. Neither assumptions about components latency nor worst case approach are required. Experimental results show significant performance increase, with limited area overhead, with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.},

Examples of issues affecting both the domains are: large parallelism degrees, heterogeneity, power constraints, reliability issues, self-adaptation, and significant programming efforts to reach the desired performance on increasingly complex architectures. Systems able to dynamically adjust their behavior at run-time appear good candidates for the next computing generation, and will most probably condemn non-adaptable systems to rapid extinction. Adaptive systems can deal with uncertain and unpredictable conditions, due, for example, to reliability issues. In this paper we show how we can exploit adaptivity analysis to address several design challenges in embedded systems.

   abstract={High Level Synthesis (HLS) provides automatic flows for the generation of hardware accelerators starting from their behavioral description. HLS guarantees results comparable to hand-written design for some applications domains such as Digital Signal Processing. However, it is not yet able to cope with performance requirements when scaling the application complexity. One of the biggest limitation is an execution paradigm still based on the construction of a centralized Finite State Machine (FSM). Parallelism exploitation is thus bound to Instruction Level Parallelism within a single execution flow. This is in contrast to the current trends for hardware architectures and programming languages, which are progressively moving towards execution paradigms dominated other type of parallelisms, such as Task or Thread Level Parallelism. This work proposes a novel adaptive accelerator design, not based on the FSM execution paradigm, which provides support to dynamic parallel execution. Execution is parallel, because no pre-computed scheduled is considered. Operations are directly managed by dedicated lightweight hardware modules, which directly communicate to notify execution completion and to start other dependent operations. Execution is parallel, because several execution flows may run concurrently. The proposed design targets different application domains, from Embedded Systems accelerators to hybrid high-performance architectures.},

   abstract={Streaming applications can efficiently exploit multiprocessors architectures by means of pipelined parallelism, but designing this type of applications can be an hard task. Different subproblems have indeed to be solved: partitioning, mapping, scheduling and pipeline stage assignment. For this reason, high level abstraction models are adopted during design flow since they simplify this process by hiding most of the architectural details. Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) graphs, widely adopted to describe streaming applications, naturally model only their partitioning, so they usually have to be integrated with other types of representations. In this paper Pipelined Application Modeling (PAM), a methodology to create a Synchronous Data Flow graph describing all the aspects of a pipelined application, is presented. The methodology starts from the SDF graph describing the partitioning of the application and enriches it with new actors and channels detailing the mapping, the scheduling and the pipeline stage assignment of the considered solution. The obtained SDF graph, describing all the aspects of the solution in a formal and compact way, facilitates the evaluation of different solutions during design space exploration.},

   abstract={Emerging applications such as bioinformatics and knowledge discovery algorithms are irregular. They generate unpredictable memory accesses and are mostly memory bandwidth bound. Several efforts are looking at accelerating these applications on hybrid architectures, which integrate general purpose processors with reconfigurable devices. Some solutions include custom-hand tuned accelerators on the reconfigurable logic. Hand crafted accelerators provide great performance benefits, but their development time often discourages their adoption. We propose a novel High Level Synthesis approach, for the automatic generation of adaptive custom accelerators, able to manage multiple execution flows. Our approach supports multiple, multi-ported and distributed memories, and atomic operations. It features a memory interface controller, which maps unpredictable memory access requests to the corresponding memory ports, while managing concurrency. We present a case study on a typical irregular kernel, the Graph Breadth First search, evaluating performance tradeoffs when varying the number of memories and the number of concurrent flows.},

   abstract={Since time constraints are a very critical aspect of an embedded system, performance evaluation can not be postponed to the end of the design flow, but it has to be introduced since its early stages. Estimation techniques based on mathematical models are usually preferred during this phase since they provide quite accurate estimation of the application performance in a fast way. However, the estimation error has to be considered during design space exploration to evaluate if a solution can be accepted (e.g., by discarding solutions whose estimated time is too close to constraint). Evaluate if the possible error can be significant analyzing a punctual estimation is not a trivial task. In this paper we propose a methodology, based on statistical analysis, that provides a prediction interval on the estimation and a confidence level on meeting a time constraint. This information can drive design space exploration reducing the number of solutions to be validated. The results show how the produced intervals effectively capture the estimation error introduced by a linear model.},

   abstract={In the last decade automotive audio has been gaining great attention by the scientific and industrial communities. In this context, a new approach to test and develop advanced audio algorithms for an heterogeneous embedded platform has been proposed within the European hArtes project. A real audio laboratory installed in a real car (hArtes CarLab) has been developed employing professional audio equipment. The algorithms can be tested and validated on a PC exploiting each application as a plug-in of the real time NU-Tech framework. Then a set of tools (hArtes Toolchain) can be used to generate code for the embedded platform starting from the plug-in implementation. An overview of the whole system is here presented, taking into consideration a complete set of audio algorithms developed for the advanced car infotainment system (ACIS) that is composed of three main different applications regarding the In Car listening and communication experience. Starting from a high level description of the algorithms, several implementations on different levels of hardware abstraction are presented, along with empirical results on both the design process undergone and the performance results achieved.},

This was the case of the memory analyser QUAD which does a detailed analysis of the memory accesses. Other tools, such as the rSesame tool, were developed and explored in parallel with the hArtes tool chain. This tool assumes a KPN-version of the application and then allows for high level simulation and experimentation with different mappings and partitionings. Finally, ReSP was developed to validate the partitioning results before a real implementation was possible.},

   abstract={Heterogeneous architectures are becoming an increasingly relevant component for High-Performance Computing: they combine the computational power of multi-core processors with the flexibility of reconfigurable co-processor boards. Such boards are often composed of a set of standard Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), coupled with a distributed memory architecture. This allows the concurrent execution of memory access operations. Nevertheless, since the execution latency of these operations may be unknown at compile-time, the synthesis of such parallelizing accelerators becomes a complex task. In fact, standard approaches require the construction of Finite State Machines (FSMs) whose complexity, in terms of number of states and transitions, increases exponentially with respect to the number of unbounded operations that may execute concurrently. We propose an adaptive architecture for such accelerators which overcome this limitation, while exploiting the available parallelism. The proposed design methodology is compared with FSM-based approaches by means of a motivational example.},

Adaptive systems are, thus, one of the most important solutions to substitute traditional approaches, based on analysis at design time, especially in critical environments. In this paper, we present an innovative lightweight controller architecture able to automatically adjust its behavior at run-time. It interacts with the surrounding environment by means of a simple token-based communication schema. We examine the capabilities of the proposed architectural model to adapt its behavior during the execution, compared to classical ones, such as the finite state machine.},

This paper presents a design methodology to efficiently and automatically implement memory accesses in High-Level Synthesis. In particular, the approach starts from a behavioral specification (in pure C language) and a set of design constraints, such as the memory addresses where some of the data are stored.
The methodology classifies which variables can be internally or externally allocated to the different modules to generate the proper architecture, fully supporting a wide range of C constructs, such as pointer arithmetic, function calls and array accesses. Moreover it allows to parallelize the accesses when the memory address is known at compile time, resulting in an efficient execution of the specification.},

The hArtes toolchain provides (semi) automatic support to the designer for this mapping effort. A hardware platform was specifically designed for the project, which consists of an ARM processor, a DSP and an FPGA. The toolchain, targeting this platform but potentially targeting any similar system, has been tested and validated on several computationally intensive applications and resulted in substantial speedups as well as drastically reduced development times. We report speedups of up to nine times compared against a pure ARM based execution, and mapping can be done in minutes. The toolchain thus allows for easy design space exploration to find the best mapping, given hardware availability and real time execution constraints.},

Normally, the performance evaluation is performed using a simulator or a performance mathematical model of the target architecture. However, both these approaches are usually based on the knowledge of the architectural details of the target. In this paper we present a methodology for automatically building an analytical model to estimate the performance of an application on a generic processor without requiring any information about the processor architecture but the one provided by the GNU GCC Intermediate Representation. The proposed methodology exploits the linear regression technique based on an application analysis performed on the Register Transfer Level internal representation of the GNU GCC compiler. The benefits of working with this type of model and with this intermediate representation are three: we take into account most of the compiler optimizations, we implicitly consider some architectural characteristics of the target processor and we can easily estimate the performance of portions of the specification. We validate our approach by evaluating with cross-validation technique the accuracy and the generality of the performance models built for the ARM926EJ-S and the LEON3 processors},

In this paper we present a methodology to estimate the performance of a function on a given dataset on a DSP. Estimation is performed combining the host profiling data with the function GNU GCC GIMPLE representation. Starting from the results of this analysis, we build a performance model of a DSP by exploiting the Linear Regression Technique. Use of GIMPLE representation allows to take directly into account the target-independent optimizations performed by the DSP compiler.

The designer has to assure that the estimation error of the simulator meets the design constraints on every application. If an application is not correctly estimated, the designer has to identify on which parts of the application the simulator introduces an estimation error and consequently fix the simulator. However, detecting which are the mispredicted parts of a very large application can be a difficult process which requires a lot of time. In this paper we propose a methodology which helps the designer to fast and automatically isolate the portions of the application mispredicted by a simulator. This is accomplished by recursively analyzing the application source code trace highlighting the mispredicted sections of source code. The results obtained applying the methodology to the TSIM simulator show how our methodology is able to fast analyze large applications isolating small portions of mispredicted code.},

   abstract={To exploit the power of modern heterogeneous multiprocessor embedded platforms on partitioned applications, the designer usually needs to efficiently map and schedule all the tasks and the communications of the application, respecting the constraints imposed by the target architecture. Since the problem is heavily constrained, common methods used to explore such design space usually fail, obtaining low-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose an ant colony optimization (ACO) heuristic that, given a model of the target architecture and the application, efficiently executes both scheduling and mapping to optimize the application performance. We compare our approach with several other heuristics, including simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic algorithms, on the performance to reach the optimum value and on the potential to explore the design space. We show that our approach obtains better results than other heuristics by at least 16% on average, despite an overhead in execution time. Finally, we validate the approach by scheduling and mapping a JPEG encoder on a realistic target architecture.},

   abstract={In this paper we present a new technique for automatically measuring the performance of tasks, functions or arbitrary parts of a program on a multiprocessor embedded system. The technique instruments the tasks described by OpenMP, used to represent the task parallelism, while ad hoc pragmas in the source indicate other pieces of code to profile. The annotations and the instrumentation are completely target-independent, so the same code can be measured on different target architectures, on simulators or on prototypes. We validate the approach on a single and on a dual LEON 3 platform synthesized on FPGA, demonstrating a low instrumentation overhead. We show how the information obtained with this technique can be easily exploited in a hardware/software design space exploration tool, by estimating, with good accuracy, the speed-up of a parallel application given the profiling on the single processor prototype.},

   title = {Fitness inheritance in evolutionary and multi-objective high-level synthesis},
   abstract = {The high-level synthesis process allows the automatic design and implementation of digital circuits starting from a behavioral description. Evolutionary algorithms are very widely adopted to approach this problem or just part of it. Neverthless, some concerns regarding execution times exist. In evolutionary high-level synthesis, design solutions have to be evaluated to extract information about some figures of merit (such as performance, area, etc.) and to allow the genetic algorithm to evolve and converge to Pareto-optimal solutions. Since the execution time of such evaluations increases with the complexity of the specification, the overall methodology could lead to unacceptable execution time. This paper presents a model to exploit fitness inheritance in a multi-objective optimization algorithm (i.e. NSGA-II) by substituting the expensive real evaluations with estimations based on closeness in an hypothetical design space. The estimations are based on the measure of the distance between individuals and a weighted average of the fitnesses of the closest ones. The results shows that the Pareto-optimal set obtained by applying the proposed model well approximates the set obtained without fitness inheritance. Moreover, the overall execution time is reduced up to the 25% in average.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an embedded system design toolchain for automatic generation of parallel code runnable on symmetric multiprocessor systems from an initial sequential specification written using the C language. We show how the initial C specification is translated in a modified system dependence graph with feedback edges (FSDG) composing the intermediate representation which is manipulated by the algorithm. Then we describe how this graph is partitioned and optimized: at the end of the process each partition (cluster of nodes) represents a different task. The parallel C code produced is such that the tasks can be dynamically scheduled on the target architecture; this is obtained thanks to the introduction of start conditions for each task. We present the experimental results obtained by applying our flow on the sequential code of the ADPCM and JPEG algorithms and by running the parallel specification, produced by the toolchain, on the target platform: with respect to the sequential specification, speedups up to 70% and 42% were obtained for the two benchmarks respectively.},

A fast heuristic to the template identification is proposed and analyzed on a standard set of benchmarks both sequential and combinational.},

   booktitle = {Proceedings of the International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation {IC-SAMOS}},
   abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) to synthesize multiple complex modules on programmable devices (FPGAs). It starts from a behavioral description written in a common high-level language (for instance C) to automatically produce the register-transfer level (RTL) design in a hardware description language (e.g. Verilog). Since all high-level synthesis problems (scheduling, allocation and binding) are notoriously NP-complete and interdependent, the three problems should be considered simultaneously. This drives to a wide design space, that needs to be thoroughly explored to obtain solutions able to satisfy the design constraints. Evolutionary algorithms are good candidates to tackle such complex explorations. In this paper we provide a solution based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to explore the design space in order obtain the best solutions in terms of performance given the area constraints of a target FPGA device. Moreover, it has been integrated a good cost estimation model to guarantee the quality of the solutions found without requiring a complete synthesis for the validation of each generation, an impractical and time consuming operation. We show on the JPEG case study that the proposed approach provides good results in terms of trade-off between total area occupied and execution time.},

In particular, the effect of speculative code transformations on mixed control-data flow designs has demonstrated effective results on schedule lengths. In this paper we first analyze the use of the control and data dependence graph as an intermediate representation that provides the possibility of extracting the maximum parallelism. Then we analyze the scheduling problem by formulating an approach based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to minimize the number of control steps given the amount of resources. We improve the already proposed ILP scheduling approaches by introducing a new conditional resource sharing constraint which is then extended to the case of speculative computation. The ILP formulation has been solved by using a Branch and Cut framework which provides better results than standard branch and bound techniques.},
