  \page dev_page Contributing to the PandA Project

  The PandA Project is an open-source project whose purpose is to provide an extensible platform to enable better research and development of new algorithms in the High-Level Synthesis field.

  \section dev_page_style Coding and documentation 
  Here you will find useful information on how to contribute to the existing codebase in a proper and productive manner following code standards, coding styles, and documentation:
  - \ref dev_guide_makefiles
  - \ref dev_guide_programming
  - \ref dev_guide_documentation


  \section dev_page_bambu Extend PandA Bambu HLS tool
  Bambu HLS is the High-Level Synthesis tool of the PandA framework. 
  The HLS flow implemented by Bambu HLS may be extended at many levels adding optimization passes in the frontend, new HLS algorithms in the backend, or new hardware modules in the hardware 
  generation engine.
  How to extend Bambu HLS under its many aspects is described in the following chapters:
  - \ref dev_bambu_frontend
  - \ref dev_bambu_modgen
  - \ref dev_bambu_device
