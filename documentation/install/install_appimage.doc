  \page install_appimage Install PandA framework AppImage distribution
  The easiest way to install PandA is to download the AppImage package from our website.
  The AppImage is a self-contained pre-built distribution of the PandA framework that requires only a minimum set of prerequisites to be installed on the host machine.

  You can find the latest PandA AppImage at https://release.bambuhls.eu/.

  The following steps are needed to run the PandA AppImage distribution:

  \section install_appimage_req Install AppImage prerequisites
  Running PandA AppImage requires a minimum set of prerequisites to be installed in the host operationg system.

  For Debian-based OS the following command may be used:
  \verbatim
  sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib libfuse-dev
  \endverbatim

  For CentOS/RHEL-based OS the following command may be used:
  \verbatim
  sudo dnf install -y fuse-libs gcc gcc-c++ glibc-devel.i686 libgcc.i686 libstdc++-devel.i686 ncurses-devel.i686
  \endverbatim


  \section install_appimage_download Download PandA AppImage
  Now you may download your preferred PandA AppImage distribution from https://release.bambuhls.eu/.
  You may use the following command to get the latest stable version:
  \verbatim
  wget https://release.bambuhls.eu/bambu-latest.AppImage
  \endverbatim

  You may use the following command to get the latest development version:
  \verbatim
  wget https://release.bambuhls.eu/bambu-latest-dev.AppImage
  \endverbatim


  \section install_appimage_setup Setup and run PandA framework tools
  Once the download has completed, you need to give execution permissions to the AppImage package as follows:
  \verbatim
  chmod +x bambu-latest.AppImage
  \endverbatim

  Now you may use the AppImage directly as the PandA Bambu HLS executable as follows:
  \verbatim
  ./bambu-latest.AppImage --help
  \endverbatim

  \section install_appimage_system Install PandA AppImage system-wide
  To use PandA framework tools easily you can create special links to the AppImage package directly in your system bin directory.
  As an example, to install PandA Bambu HLS tool system-wide you can use the following command:
  \verbatim
  ln -s /absolute/path/to/downloaded/bambu-latest.AppImage /usr/bin/bambu
  \endverbatim

  After that, you can launch PandA Bambu HLS directly from any shell by just typing bambu.
  
  The same procedure is valid for any of the PandA framework tools:
  - bambu
  - eucalyptus
  - spider


  \section install_appimage_shell Launch a shell within the AppImage environment
  The AppImage distribution is a self-contained package where all the dependencies required for the execution of PandA tools are embedded, thus generated scripts may not be able to run successfully outside this environment.
  If you need to run generated scripts, like the HW/SW co-simulation script, you can start a shell within the AppImage environment by doing as follows.

  First, create a link to the AppImage file and name it panda_shell:
  \verbatim
  ln -s /absolute/path/to/downloaded/bambu-latest.AppImage panda_shell
  \endverbatim

  Now launch the shell using the panda_shell link just created and use it as normal to launch PandA-related tools and scripts.
  \verbatim
  ./panda_shell
  \endverbatim
