|    1. This source code is modified to unify the formats of the benchmark |
|       programs in CHStone.                                               |
|    2. Test vectors are added for CHStone.                                |
|    3. If "main_result" is 0 at the end of the program, the program is    |
|       correctly executed.                                                |
|    4. Please follow the copyright of each benchmark program.             |

| The `LIT64' macro takes as its argument a textual integer literal and
| if necessary ``marks'' the literal as having a 64-bit integer type.
| For example, the GNU C Compiler (`gcc') requires that 64-bit literals be
| appended with the letters `LL' standing for `long long', which is `gcc's
| name for the 64-bit integer type.  Some compilers may allow `LIT64' to be
| defined as the identity macro:  `#define LIT64( a ) a'.

#define LIT64( a ) a##LL

| The macro `INLINE' can be used before functions that should be inlined.  If
| a compiler does not support explicit inlining, this macro should be defined
