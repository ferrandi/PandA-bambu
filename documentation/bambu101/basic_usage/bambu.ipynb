The input representation can be any high-level language supported by the HLS tool (i.e.: C/C++,FORTRAN,SystemC) which takes care of both optimization and translation to the output RTL-level language (i.e.: Verilog, VHDL).\n",

Finally, the backend takes care of translating the code into an hardware design instantiating functional units, generating a schedule for the operations, and binding each operation to a functional unit."
