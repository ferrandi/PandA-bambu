  \section graphviz_tag GraphViz
  
  The GraphViz package consists of a variety of software for drawing attributed graphs. 
  The package was designed to rely on the "program-as-filter" model of 
  software, in which distinct graph operations or transformations are embodied as programs. 
  Graph drawing and manipulation are achieved by using the output of one filter as the input 
  of another, with each filter recognizing a common graph format [GAN00].
  Despite the simplicity and utility of this approach, some applications need or desire to 
  use the software as a library with bindings in a non-scripting language, rather than as 
  primitives composed by a scripting language. The GraphViz software provides a variety of 
  ways to achieve this, running a spectrum from very simple but somewhat inflexible 
  to fairly complex but offering a good deal of application control [ERG03].

  \subsection graphviz_dot GraphViz tools and DOT language
  One of the tools provided by GraphViz tool set is \c dot.
  The \c dot tool draws directed graphs as hierarchies. It runs as a command line program.
  Its features include well-tuned layout algorithms for placing nodes and edge splines, 
  edge labels, "record" shapes with "ports" for drawing data structures; cluster layouts; 
  and an underlying file language for stream-oriented graph tools.

  \c dot reads attributed graph text files and writes drawings, either as graph files or in a 
  graphics format such as GIF, PNG, SVG or PostScript (which can be converted to PDF).
  \c dot accepts input in the \c DOT language. An example of graph description based on \c DOT
  language is the following:
  \verbatim
  digraph G {
      main -> parse -> execute;
      main -> init;
      main -> cleanup;
      execute -> make_string;
      execute ->printf;
      init -> make_string;
      main -> printf;
      execute -> compare;
  }
  \endverbatim
  A node is created when its name first appears in the file. An edge is created when nodes 
  are joined by the edge operator ->.
  In the following line is described an edge between node main and node init.
  \verbatim
      main -> init;
  \endverbatim
  It is quite simple to create the postscript file from the above text file. In fact, it is 
  only required to run the following command provided the name of file is small_graph.dot:
  \verbatim
  dot -Tps small_graph.dot -o small_graph.ps
  \endverbatim
  The graph produced is:
  \dot  
  digraph G {
      main -> parse -> execute;
      main -> init;
      main -> cleanup;
      execute -> make_string;
      execute ->printf;
      init -> make_string;
      main -> printf;
      execute -> compare;
  }
  \enddot
  The command line option \c -Tps selects PostScript (EPSF) output. \c small_graph.ps may be 
  printed, displayed by a PostScript viewer, or embedded in another document.  

  Another useful tool based on \c dot is \c dotty which is a graph editor for the X Window System.

  \subsection graphviz_documentation Documentation
  Documentation about GraphViz and the DOT language can be found at http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/refs.html .

  \subsection graphviz_download Download
  It is possible to download the last version of the GraphViz tool both for Windows and Linux 
  from the official website: http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/CURRENT/.

  \section doxygen_tag Doxygen

  \c Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, IDL (Corba and Microsoft 
  flavors) and to some extent PHP, C# and D. 
  It can help you in three ways: 
  - It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference 
    manual (in LateX) from a set of documented source files. There is also support for 
    generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and 
    Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it 
    much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code. 
  - You can configure \c doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files. 
    This is very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions. You can also 
    visualize the relations between the various elements by means of include dependency graphs, 
    inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically. 
  - You can even `abuse' \c doxygen for creating normal documentation. 

  Doxygen is developed under Linux, but is set-up to be highly portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore, executables for Windows 9x/NT and Mac OS X are available.

  \subsection doxygen_download Download
  Each Linux distribution provides Doxygen as developing tool, therefore before download it please check the web site check 
  your distribution. The official WEB site is http://www.doxygen.org/.
