\page graphs_how_to How to Use the boost::graph Library
The PandA project makes an extensive use of graphs; in particular it builds them using the boost::graph library (http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/). In this page we plan to give you a short introduction on how it is possible to use a graph and on how it is possible to create a new type of graph.
