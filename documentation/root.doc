   \mainpage PandA Project Documentation
   The primary objective of the PandA project is to develop a usable framework that will enable the research of new ideas in the HW-SW Co-Design field.<br/>
   The PandA framework includes methodologies supporting the research on the high-level synthesis of hardware accelerators, parallelism extraction for embedded systems, hardware/software partitioning and mapping, metrics for performance estimation of embedded software applications, and dynamically reconfigurable devices.

   PandA software is released under the \ref panda_license "GNU General Public License version 3" and developed at Politecnico di Milano (Italy).


   \section main_getstarted Getting started
   The following can be helpful to start using the PandA framework and understand its features:
   - \ref panda_overview
   - \ref panda_install
   - \ref bambu101_page
   - \ref examples_page


   \section main_devlines Developer's guidelines
   The PandA framework is an open-source project where you can integrate your own algorithms to enhance the available features and build new ones as needed.<br/>
   The following can be useful to approach the PandA codebase and start developing:
   - \ref bambu_overview
   - \ref install_docker
   - \ref dev_page
