"A fast and low-overhead technique to secure programs against integer overflows", In Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) (CGO '13). Washington, DC, USA, 1-11.
    The implementation started from code available at this link:https://code.google.com/archive/p/range-analysis/.
    The original code went through a deep revision and it has been changed to be compatible with a recent version of LLVM. Some extensions have been also added:
    - Added anti range support.

    Millions of Lines of Code", by Ben Hardekopf & Calvin Lin, in PLDI 2007.
    The BDD library used is the Buddy BDD package By Jørn Lind-Nielsen. Users working on a Debian/Ubuntu distribution can install the libbdd-dev package.

- A single-precision floating-point faithfully rounded powf function has been added. It follows the method published in:
  Florent De Dinechin, Pedro Echeverria, Marisa Lopez-Vallejo, Bogdan Pasca. Floating-Point Exponentiation Units for Reconfigurable Computing. ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS), ACM, 2013, 6 (1), pp.4:1–4:15.
  The powf function currently does not supports subnormals.

- Added support to top design interfaces: none (ap_none), acknowledge (ap_ack), valid (ap_vld), ovalid (ap_ovld), handshake (ap_hs), fifo (ap_fifo) and array (ap_memory). These interfaces are activated by pragmas added to the source code and when the option --generate-interface=INFER is passed to bambu.
